    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday I participated in my first <a href="http://icpc.baylor.edu/">programming
contest</a>. It was very fun, though challenging, and I
learned a fair bit during it. <!-- more --> The content consisted of teams of
3 working to solve 6 problems as fast as possible. The problems ranged from
trivial (repeated arithmetic) to moderately complex.</p>

<h2>Problem solving is fun.</h2>

<p>I already knew this, but it has been some time since I&rsquo;ve done intense
problem solving. It was nice to sit down for a few hours and bang my head
on a problem. Creative problem solving just <em>feels</em> good, in a way that most
activities don&rsquo;t.</p>

<h2>I don&rsquo;t know much about algorithms or data structures</h2>

<p>Of course I know the basic search and sorts, but anything involving
anything more complex than binary trees is beyond my current knowledge. A
few of the problems were solved very elegantly with tree operations. I was
unable to come up with a way to express the operation I wanted to perform.
It&rsquo;s a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_path_problem">standard problem</a>
which I had not been aware of.</p>

<p>Now that I <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_known_knowns">know what I don&rsquo;t
know</a>, I can expand my
knowledge.</p>

<h2>C++&rsquo;s iostreams are quite nice</h2>

<p>Previously I haven&rsquo;t been a fan of iostreams, due to their misplaced
pedagogical use. But, for simply reading whitespace-separated data from stdin
and outputting the same to stdout, there probably isn&rsquo;t anything easier. I
might implement something similar (though not using the <code>&gt;&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;&lt;</code>
operators).</p>
